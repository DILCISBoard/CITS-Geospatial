CITS Geospatial
=============
## E-ARK Content Information Type Specification for digital geospatial data records archiving
The CITS Geospatial version 3.0.0 is an updated version of the specification, defining the approach to preserve all types of digital geospatial records. Key changes in this version include a revised structure of geodata elements and its placement within the eArchiving Information Package. In the work with this update the result includes the conclusion of CITS GIS being a part of CITS Geospatial and thus no CITS GIS is developed.

## Guideline for the specification for the E-ARK Content Information Type Specification for digital geospatial data records archiving (CITS Geospatial)
The purpose of this guideline and its 3 appendixes is to further explain and describe the “Content Information Type Specification for Geospatial data” (also called CITS Geospatial in short). The goal is that as many people as possible will be able to understand the specification and, therefore, to also preserve geodata.

## Guideline for using the specification for the E-ARK Content Information Type Specification for digital geospatial data records archiving (CITS Geospatial) with GIS
The purpose of this document is to extend the Guideline for CITS Geospatial with content describing preservation of selected elements from Geographical Information Systems (GIS). This document aims to extend the scope of preservation beyond the geospatial data records themselves and focus more on GIS elements defining geospatial information products.
