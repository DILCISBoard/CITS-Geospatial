## Non-spatial data - requirements

Geodata is often a part of a complex data structure, stored in a database and ordinary tables. To reproduce the information products from a GIS, it is often necessary to store additional tables with the geospatial records. These tables do not have a geospatial component. In this case, it is essential to store the data structure’s relationships and logic to be reconstructed in the future. For long-term preservation of additional tabular information (attribute tables, code lists, etc.) along with geospatial records, formats proposed for RDBMS archiving are used. For example, the standard SIARD, available at <https://dilcis.eu/content-types/siard> and used in the Content information Type Specification for Relational Databases using SIARD (CITS SIARD), available at <https://dilcis.eu/content-types/cs-siard>.

## Long Term Preservation Format Profiles

A “Long Term Preservation format Profile” contains a set of one or more base or subsets of base standards, and, where applicable, the identification of chosen clauses, classes, options, and parameters of those base standards, that are necessary for geospatial records to comply with the internal Archival Long Term Preservation guidelines for the selection of long-term preservation formats.

A “Long Term Preservation format Profile” would specify a proposed format for long term specification, its justification according to internal Archival guidelines (to ensure long-term preservation and reuse), a list of required auxiliary files and documentation and validation criteria to ensure structural and content suitability.

## Other Geospatial data

This specification does not cover any specific requirements for basic or more complex geospatial records (such as networks, structures combining raster and vector data, point clouds, 3D features, oblique Imagery, Satellite Imagery, etc.). However, the specification will be extended
with “Long Term Preservation format Profiles” for additional geospatial formats in the future.
