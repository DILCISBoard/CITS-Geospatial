## Data requirements (Geospatial data)

This chapter states the requirements for the content data object or objects that form the geospatial record contained in the Information package.

The sections 3.3 – 3.5 of this document do not discuss optimisations with respect to packaging and storage. The requirements for data, metadata and documentation only suggest what information is needed and the appropriate placement of it, not how it is packaged, stored and optimised for automatic handling.
