# Geospatial Metadata requirements

Geospatial data in the IP is documented using a form of geospatial metadata, which contains common descriptions of the data as well as descriptions specific to the geospatial domain (accuracy, lineage, scale, measurement units, CRS info, etc.). In original systems,
geospatial metadata can be stored in different ways (databases, standardised xml files, common documentation, etc.).
