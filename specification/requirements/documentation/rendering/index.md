## Rendering and visualisation

Rendering and visualisation documentation represents any information that contributes to the recreation of the performance of the Information Object. Example: Colour map of pixel values in raster datasets, Symbology configuration for vector datasets, Map setup; Web service, etc.

To document visualisation, there is a need for GIS documentation and samples of geospatial information products (maps, lists, charts, new geodata derived from existing data, web services, etc.).
