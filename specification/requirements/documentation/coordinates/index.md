### Coordinate reference system information- requirements

Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition is essential for effective reuse of all geospatial records. When the CRS of the geodata in the Information Package is described by only referencing a well-known external database of CRS definitions (such as the EPSG database), the availability of these definitions is dependent upon the long-term existence of that database. Therefore, a CITS Geospatial Information Package must contain these definitions to be self-descriptive.
