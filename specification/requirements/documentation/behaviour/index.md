### Behaviour - Software and algorithms

To facilitate the reproduction of information products in future System (for example: reconstruct common queries for a specific geospatial dataset), there is often a need to run specific database queries or geo-specific processes. However, some information can only be accessed using functionalities of the original System. Therefore, preserving user manuals and system documentation of original systems is also recommended to preserve the behaviour aspect.
