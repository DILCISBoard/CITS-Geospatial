# Glossary

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Archival information package (AIP)** | An Information Package, consisting of the Content Information and the associated Preservation Description Information (PDI), which is preserved within an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) |
| **Cardinality** | The term describes the possible number of occurrences for elements in a set. The numbers have the following meanings: (1..1) – In each set, there is exactly 1 such element present (0..1) – The set can contain from 0 to 1 of such elements (1..n) – The set contains at least one element – up to n elements (0..n) – The package can contain up to n of such elements, but it is not mandatory (0..0) – The element is prohibited to use |
| **Content Data Object** | The Data Object, that together with associated Representation Information comprises the Content Information [Source OAIS - ISO 14721:2012] |
| **Content Information** | A set of information that is the original target of preservation or includes part or all of that information. It is an Information Object composed of its Content Data Object and its Representation Information. [Source OAIS - ISO 14721:2012] |
| **Coordinate Reference System (CRS)** | CRS is a coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum. Geodetic and vertical datums are referred to as reference frames. [Source ISO 19111:2019] |
| **Digital geospatial record** | A digital geospatial record is a record containing a spatial graphical component describing an object in space. It can be created digitally or digitised from an analogue source (paper maps). |
| **Dissemination Information package (DIP)** | An Information Package, derived from one or more AIPs, and sent by Archives to the Consumer in response to a request to the OAIS. |
| **Feature** | Abstraction of real-world phenomena. EXAMPLE: The phenomenon named “Eiffel Tower” may be classified with other similar phenomena into a feature type “tower.” A feature may occur as a type or an instance. Feature type or feature instance should be used when only one is meant. [SOURCE: ISO 19101‑1:2014, 4.1.11] |
| **Feature Attribute** | Characteristic of a feature. EXAMPLE 1: A feature attribute named “colour” can have an attribute value “green” which belongs to the data type “text”. EXAMPLE 2: A feature attribute named “length” can have an attribute value “82,4” which belongs to the data type “real”. [SOURCE: ISO 19101‑1:2014, 4.1.12] |
| **Feature Catalogue** | Catalogue containing definitions and descriptions of the feature types, feature attributes, and feature relationships occurring in one or more sets of geographic data, together with any feature operations that can be applied [SOURCE: ISO 19101‑1:2014, 4.1.13] |
| **Feature Dataset** | Identifiable collection of data. A dataset can be a smaller grouping of data that is located physically within a larger dataset, though limited by some constraint such as spatial extent or feature type. Theoretically, a dataset can be as small as a single feature or feature attribute contained within a larger dataset. A hardcopy map or chart can be considered a dataset. [SOURCE: ISO 19115‑1:2014, 4.13] |
| **Feature Instance** | Individual of a given feature type having specified feature attribute values [SOURCE: ISO 19101‑1:2014, 4.1.14] |
| **Feature Operation** | Operation that every instance of a feature type can perform EXAMPLE: A feature operation upon a “dam” is to raise the dam. The results of this operation are to raise the height of the “dam” and the level of water in a “reservoir”. Feature operations provide a basis for feature type definition. [SOURCE: ISO 19110:2005, 4.5] |
| **Feature Type** | Class of features having common characteristics [SOURCE: ISO 19156:2011, 4.7] |
| **Geodata layer** | A Geodata layer is a representation of one or many feature datasets within a GIS System. It can contain additional representation information such as visualisation, labelling of the dataset, visibility under certain conditions based on scale, SQL query, etc. |
| **Geospatial data processing workflow** | A geospatial data processing workflow is usually defined as a set of processing tasks organised into a process. Tasks are functions of a GIS system used to manipulate, transform or manage geospatial datasets, maps and tables. |
| **GIS** | Abbreviation for Geographical Information System, which is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyse, manage, and present spatial or geographic data. |
| **GIS Project** | A GIS project is a document that organises geospatial datasets into layers, defines the map representations, then reports and stores information on Geoprocessing workflows. |
| **Information Package** | A logical container composed of optional Content Information and optional associated Preservation Description Information. Associated with this Information Package is Packaging Information used to delimit and identify the Content Information and Package Description information used to facilitate searches for the Content Information. |
| **Information Product** | Generally, an Information product is an item that has been derived from one or more sources of information to meet a specific purpose. A Geospatial information product is an output derived from one or more geospatial (and other) records. Examples include: Printed or digital maps, Lists of addresses in a certain area, calculation of an optimal path, calculated area, length or volume, etc. An information product can be in the form of a new geospatial record, an image, a document, a database table, etc. |
| **INSPIRE directive** | The INSPIRE directive [https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/) aims to create a European Union spatial data infrastructure for the purposes of EU environmental policies and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment. This European Spatial Data Infrastructure will enable the sharing of environmental spatial information among public sector organisations, facilitate public access to spatial information across Europe and assist in policymaking across boundaries. INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information established and operated by the Member States of the European Union. The Directive addresses 34 spatial data themes needed for environmental applications. The Directive came into force on 15 May 2007 and will be implemented in various stages, with full implementation required by 2021. |
| **Internal Archival Long Term Preservation guidelines** | This type of guideline can have different names depending on the creator. Generally, archives specify technical guidelines and/or regulations for formats, specifying what they will accept and maintain for the long term. Depending on the archive and available technical resources, the criteria for the selected formats can differ from archive to archive. |
| **Level** | The level of requirement of the element following RFC 2119 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) **MUST** This word mean that the definition is an absolute requirement. **SHOULD** This word mean that in particular circumstances, valid reasons may exist to ignore the requirement, but, the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course. **MUST NOT** This phrase mean that the prohibition described in the requirement is an absolute prohibition of the use of the element. **SHOULD NOT** This phrase mean that in particular circumstances, violating the prohibition described in the requirement is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before doing so. The requirement text should clarify such circumstances. **MAY** This word mean that an item is not prohibited but entirely optional. |
| **Standardised Machine- readable Documentation** | A standardised machine-readable document is a document which content can be readily processed by computers and is based on a commonly accepted standard. Such documents are distinguished from machine-readable data by virtue of having sufficient structure to provide the necessary context to support the business processes for which they are created. |
| **Open Archival Information System (OAIS)** | An Archive consisting of an organisation, which may be part of a larger organisation, of people and systems, that has accepted the responsibility to preserve information and make it available for a Designated Community. It meets a set of responsibilities, as defined in section 4, that allows an OAIS Archive to be distinguished from other uses of the term 'Archive'. The term 'Open' in OAIS is used to imply that this Recommendation and future related Recommendations and standards are developed in open forums, and it does not imply that access to the Archive is unrestricted. |
| **Preservation Description Information (PDI)** | The information which is necessary for adequate preservation of the Content Information and which can be categorised as Provenance, Reference, Fixity, Context, and Access Rights Information. |
| **Projected coordinate systems** | Coordinate reference system derived from a geographic coordinate reference system by applying a map projection |
| **RDBMS** | Relational Database Management System |
| **Representation** | A Representation within an Information Package contains archival data. If an Information Package contain the same data in two or more different formats (i.e., Original and a long-term preservation format) or in different types of organisations, they are organised within two or more representations within the Representations folder of the Information Package |
| **Representation Information** | The Representation Information must enable or allow the recreation of the significant properties of the original data object. In terms of geospatial data, we need the information required to reconstruct the usage of the records meaningfully. For example, if we want to adequately reuse a GML file, containing only the vector geometry and its accompanying attributes, we need rendering information in the form of symbology definition, labelling logic, the coordinate System and projection, the scales in which it was used and description of meanings of attributes in order to understand the data. |
| **Submission Information Package (SIP)** | An Information Package that is delivered by the Producer to the OAIS for use in the construction or update of one or more AIPs and/or the associated Descriptive Information. |
| **Technical documentation** | Technical documentation in this document is a term, referring to the content, that is essential for proper technical reuse of the initial geospatial records. In OAIS terms it would be called representation information of the Data Object. |
